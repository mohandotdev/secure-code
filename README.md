SecureCode. is an application designed to help code security by pinpointing vulnerabilities. With the help of Cloudflare AI Model, Our app detects various parameters crucial for securing your codebase:

**Vulnerability Type:** Indicate the type of vulnerability detected in the code snippet (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting, buffer overflow).

**Severity Level:** Assign a severity level to each detected vulnerability (e.g., critical, high, medium, low) to prioritize remediation efforts.

**Location:** Highlight the specific location within the code where the vulnerability was detected (e.g., line number, function name, file name) to facilitate debugging and fixing.

**Explanation:** Provide a brief explanation or description of the detected vulnerability, including how it could potentially be exploited and its impact on security.

**Recommendations:** Offer recommendations or suggested fixes to address the detected vulnerabilities, such as code changes or security best practices to follow.

**Overall Security Percentage:** Return the overall security percentage of the given code.
